# Personal Budget
 Fastify API that allows clients to create and manage a personal budget. Using Envelope Budgeting principles, this API should allow users to manage budget envelopes and track the balance of each envelope. The API should follow best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response codes, etc. and data validation to ensure users do not overspend their budget!
